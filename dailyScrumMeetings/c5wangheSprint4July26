What did I do last time?
    - Created grep class grep
    - Write unit test for grep

What do I plan to do now?
    - More comments and error checking

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Echo class cann't treat \n as line separator, searched a long time for 
     solution but get no applicable answer
     Update: just find the answer, the above problem is caused by \n in the 
     string actually be treated as \+n instead of a escape sequence.
     I tried replace the it with System.getproperty.("lineseperator"),but it 
     doesn't work
     The worked way I found is manually tear down the string and add "\n"
