Responsibilities:
 1. echo STRING > OUTFILE
Put	 STRING	 in	file OUTFILE. STRING is	a string of	characters	
surrounded	 by	 quotation	 marks.	 This creates a	new file if	
OUTFILE	 does not exist, and erases	 the old contents if 
OUTFILE already	exists.	In	either	case,	the	only	thing	in	OUTFILE	
should be STRING

 2. echo STRING >> OUTFILE
Like the previous command,but appends instead of overwrites.
