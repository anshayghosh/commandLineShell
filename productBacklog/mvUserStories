MV

As a user of this file system, 
I'd like to be able to move a directory
to another directory of my choosing

As an administrator, I'd like to make sure 
users can't accidently move a directory into
one of it's subdirectories.

As a user of the file system,
I'd like to be able to put in the full/incomplete
file path as the parameters for the mv command
