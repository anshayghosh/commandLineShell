Draft features for the Jshell:
1 Able to create a directory /folder 
2 Able to create  file 
3 Appending something into a file
4 Error checking: check the whether or not the argument is valid 
5 Parser: parse the command
6 deleting a folder 
7 Changing reference of folder/file
8 Maintain a reference of the current directory in Jshell
9 Pathfinder: find the the directory/file specified by the path and return a 
  reference to the directory/file (dose this mean file or directory should 
   inherit from the other since we cann't return two different Objects )
10 PWD: be able to print the current path
11 Man: display the details for every command 
12 Cat: display the file


Work seperation (need further discussion):

1.Implement file/ directory 

2.Pathfinder

3.Moving a folder/file
  Copy a folded/file

4.Jshell in generall :exit

5.Implementing the rest of the commands

6.miscellaneous:
